# Strategy responsibility and updates

As stated in the SimpleSAMLphp Statute [\[SSphp-Statute\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wdejs-ZtWJ0Wm9tf0p5-wMIls4Qs7016dlbD35PqV1g/edit#bookmark=id.fteiresw89az), the SimpleSAMLphp Board [\[SSphp-Board\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wdejs-ZtWJ0Wm9tf0p5-wMIls4Qs7016dlbD35PqV1g/edit#bookmark=id.k1f44eid0tty)  is responsible for defining and maintaining this strategy. The SimpleSAMLphp Board will review and if needed update this strategy from time to time, consulting with the wider community. 


# SimpleSAMLphp governance and legal home

The SimpleSAMLphp is an open collaborative software development effort, with community governance provided by the SimpleSAMLphp Board of Directors.

SimpleSAMLphp’s legal-administrative home is with The Commons Conservancy [\[CC\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wdejs-ZtWJ0Wm9tf0p5-wMIls4Qs7016dlbD35PqV1g/edit#bookmark=id.ejy0t79fuh4x), a Netherlands-based foundation for creating and fostering a technology commons in Europe. The Commons Conservancy is a multi-tenant “foundation-as-a-service” provider hosting virtual not-for-profit organisations in the field of open source software, design and hardware development. 


# The SimpleSAMLphp software product 

The SimpleSAMLphp Programme produces open source software delivering digital identity solutions.This allows any organisation or individual to spin up a SimpleSAMLphp based service for their community, using the operational model that best fits their context and purposes. 

Currently the main target group for the SimpleSAMLphp platform is the global Research & Education sector. SimpleSAMLphp is known to be used in other sectors such as government, health, NGOs and 

commercial organisations.


# SimpleSAMLphp Strategy

SimpleSAMLphp aims to be a widely used solution enabling provision of digital identity solutions. It  supports many identity protocols and frameworks, primarily  SAML 2.0, but also OpenID, CAS, WS-Federation and OAuth, and is [extendable](https://simplesamlphp.org/modules) by adding specialized modules. 

The SimpleSAMLphp strategy is to: 

- ensures continued support, maintenance, and further development of the SimpleSAMLphp software with features sufficiently relevant to ensure the product is and remains widely deployed in the target groups;

- maintain architecture that enables interoperable core that is extendible with community contributions in a modular fashion;

- be a well-maintained, secure, well-documented product that is easy to install, integrate and operate;

- keep up-to-date to modern standards existing features, technology and project infrastructure;

- have the ability to absorb community contributions and address community reported issues effectively and  timely, while keeping it easy for maintenance;

- have a level of community-management activity that is adequate to ensure that key community members retain a sense of affiliation and solidarity with the project;

- accomplish sufficient fund-raising.


# Operational approach

To support our strategic aim of continuous software production and community development, long-term engagements for key roles are preferred. Currently identified key roles are:

\- Lead maintainer - manages ongoing communication between key project contributors via online communication channels and periodic (in-person) hackathons and setting priorities with input from the board.

\- Communications  lead  - manages web presence for the project (website, blog updates, use case stories, etc) , organizes in-person and/or virtual meetings including hackathons and gatherings at conferences and similar.  

Short term engagements may be used for specific, not continuously occurring tasks that typically are well (enough) standardised to capture in a simple description of work or tasks requiring specialised skills and knowledge we can not or do not want to maintain in the Programme. Examples of such tasks are:

\- code security audits, crypto security audits

\- designing a new UI

\- creating promotional material

Funding and sourcing strategy

Since its inception, SimpleSAMLphp has been developed using in-kind contributions. With the move of the SimpleSAMLphp project to the Common Conservancy the contributions are supplemented with the paid-for ones. 

SimpleSAMLphp’s funding strategy is to actively seek financial or in-kind contributions from organisations that use or have strategic interests to support SimpleSAMLphp software (commercial, non-profit, R\&E support organisations and collaborations, EC, open source support foundations, etc.)
