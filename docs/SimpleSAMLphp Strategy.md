[]{#anchor-5}SimpleSAMLphp governance and legal home

The SimpleSAMLphp is an open collaborative software development effort,
with community governance provided by the SimpleSAMLphp Board of
Directors.

SimpleSAMLphp's legal-administrative home is with The Commons
Conservancy [*\[CC\]*](#ejy0t79fuh4x), a Netherlands-based foundation
for creating and fostering a technology commons in Europe. The Commons
Conservancy is a multi-tenant "foundation-as-a-service" provider hosting
virtual not-for-profit organisations in the field of open source
software, design and hardware development.

[]{#anchor-6}The SimpleSAMLphp software product

SimpleSAMLphp is an open source software project that is widely used as
a digital identity solution. The core project is highly extendable and
supports many identity protocols, primarily SAML 2.0, but also for
example OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 via multiple specialized modules.

Any organisation or individual can spin up a SimpleSAMLphp based service
for their community using the operational model that best fits their
context and needs. Currently the main target group for the SimpleSAMLphp
platform is the global Research & Education sector. SimpleSAMLphp is
known to be used in other sectors such as government, health, NGOs and
commercial organisations.

[]{#anchor-7}SimpleSAMLphp Strategy

The SimpleSAMLphp software project strategy is to:

-   ensure continued support, maintenance, and further development of
    the SimpleSAMLphp software with features sufficiently relevant to
    ensure the product is and remains relevant for its target groups;
-   maintain architecture that enables interoperable core that is
    extensible with community contributions in a modular fashion;
-   be a well-maintained, secure, well-documented product that is easy
    to install, integrate and operate;
-   keep up-to-date to modern standards, existing features, technology
    and project infrastructure;
-   have the ability to absorb community contributions and address
    community reported issues effectively and timely, while keeping it
    easy for maintenance;
-   have a level of community-management activity that is adequate to
    ensure that key community members retain a sense of affiliation and
    solidarity with the project;
-   raise funds sufficient to accomplish the previous goals.

[]{#anchor-8}Operational approach

To support our strategic aim of continuous software production and
community development, long-term engagements for key roles are
preferred. Currently identified key roles are:

-   Lead Maintainer - Manages the SSP project in close collaboration
    with the developer community. Maintains and develops code as well as
    handling community contributions.
-   Lead Communications - Manages general communications and outreach on
    behalf of the SSP project, including the web presence (website, blog
    updates, use case stories, etc). Organizes in-person and/or virtual
    SSP project meetings, including hackathons and gatherings at
    conferences and similar.

Short term engagements may be used for specific, not continuously
occurring tasks that typically are well (enough) standardised to capture
in a simple description of work or tasks requiring specialised skills
and knowledge we can not or do not want to maintain in the Programme.
Examples of such tasks are:

\- code security audits, crypto security audits

\- designing a new UI

\- creating promotional material

Funding and sourcing strategy

Since its inception, SimpleSAMLphp has been developed using in-kind
contributions. With the move of the SimpleSAMLphp project to the Common
Conservancy the contributions are supplemented with the paid-for ones.

SimpleSAMLphp's funding strategy is to actively seek financial or
in-kind contributions from organisations that use or have strategic
interests to support SimpleSAMLphp software (commercial, non-profit, R&E
support organisations and collaborations, EC, open source support
foundations, etc.).

[]{#anchor-9}Strategy responsibility and updates

As stated in the SimpleSAMLphp Statute
[*\[SSP-Statute\]*](#fteiresw89az), the SimpleSAMLphp Board
[*\[SSP-Board\]*](#k1f44eid0tty) is responsible for defining and
maintaining this strategy. The SimpleSAMLphp Board will review and if
needed update this strategy from time to time, consulting with the wider
community.
